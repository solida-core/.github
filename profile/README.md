### Hi there, this is the solida-core project official repository! 👋

We are [Rossano](https://www.crs4.it/peopledetails/357/rossano-atzeni/) and [Matteo](https://github.com/massiddamt), bioinformaticians respectively at [CRS4](https://www.crs4.it) and the [University of Sassari](https://www.uniss.it/ugov/person/145801).

During these years we have worked on the development of reproducibile workflows for NGS Data Analysis.

Our pipelines, based on public tools, follow GATK Best Practices and include steps that we found useful during the analysis of samples processed in our facility.

**solida-core** is a collection of open-source Snakemake-based pipelines.
We are working to increase the number of our pipelines and, of course, to mantain up-to-date the old ones.

If you found one of our workflows useful for your project, please remember to cite us including `https://github.com/solida-core` to your references.


Thank you,

Rossano and Matteo
